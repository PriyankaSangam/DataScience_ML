Numpy
arange, linspace, random, randomint,randomn, reshape, sum, std, max, min, avg, mean, axis (0 for rows, 1 for columns)


Pandas
Open source lib built on top of Numpy
It is like excel 
Can work with data from a wide variety of sources
set inplace = True wherever applicable. Otherwise the changes made will not be applied as this is a precaution in pandas

Series, DataFrames, GroupBy, Merging, Joining, Concatenating, Operations, Data in and out
Series - index and datapoints
use bracket notation for requesting a column - variable['columnName']

Series methods - https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/series.html
DataFrame methods - https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html

Shortcut
pd.TAB - shows all the methods
pd.DataFrame(SHIFT+TAB) - shows arguments involved

Methods - loc, xs, iloc, reset_index, set_index, dropna, zip, pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples, fillna, groupby, describe, transpose, concat, merge, join, head, unique, nunique, value_counts, apply, drop, columns, rows, index, idxmax, idxmin, sort_values, isnull, pivot_table, info 

type(anything) - returns the data type
loc - location
iloc - integer location
xs - used when there is multiple indexing
reset_index
set_index
drop - rows or columns
dropna - delete the NaN values
zip 
groupby('column name') 
describe - returns all the std calculations. ex: max, min, mean/average, etc
head - returns the first five values in table. Can be set to any number of values
unique - unique values
nunique - only the number of unique values
value_counts - counts the number of times the same data appears in a column and returns in the decreasing order.
sort_values
apply - used to apply any functions. Ex: len or your own function
index
idmax and idmin - Return index of first occurrence of max/min over requested axis
shape - returns number of rows and columns

Arguments - axis, level, thresh, inplace (True to change the original index values), value/values, how, on, by, index, columns

data sources - CSV, Excel, HTML, SQL
Libraries to work with SQL and HTML- sqlalchemy, lxml, html5lib, BeautifulSoup4, xlrd

pwd can be used in jupyter notebook to check the location. All the Data files (CSV, Excel, etc.) must be located in that location.

Pandas can read files from a variety of sources - pd.read_ (press tab to see the sources)
Read - pd.read_csv
write - pd.to_csv

SQL - There are many flavours of sql like postgreSQL, Sqlite etc. Use specific drivers for each of them.
PostgreSql uses psycopg2 lib, mySQL uses pymysql
