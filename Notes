Pandas
Open source lib built on top of Numpy
It is like excel 
Can work with data from a wide variety of sources
set inplace = True wherever applicable. Otherwise the changes made will not be applied as this is a precaution in pandas

Series, DataFrames, GroupBy, Merging, Joining, Concatenating, Operations, Data in and out
Series - index and datapoints
use bracket notation for requesting a column - variable['columnName']

Shortcut
pd.TAB - shows all the methods
pd.DataFrame(SHIFT+TAB) - shows arguments involved

Methods - loc, xs, iloc, reset_index, set_index, dropna, zip, pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples, fillna, groupby, describe, transpose, concat, merge, join, head, unique, nunique, value_counts, apply, drop, columns, rows, index, sort_values, isnull, pivot_table, info 
Arguments - axis, level, thresh, inplace (True to change the original index values), value/values, how, on, by, index, columns

data sources - CSV, Excel, HTML, SQL
Libraries to work with SQL and HTML- sqlalchemy, lxml, html5lib, BeautifulSoup4, xlrd

pwd can be used in jupyter notebook to check the location. All the Data files (CSV, Excel, etc.) must be located in that location.

Pandas can read files from a variety of sources - pd.read_ (press tab to see the sources)
Read - pd.read_csv
write - pd.to_csv

SQL - There are many flavours of sql like postgreSQL, Sqlite etc. Use specific drivers for each of them.
PostgreSql uses psycopg2 lib, mySQL uses pymysql
